Answer 1:-
A Version Control System (VCS) solves several problems related to managing changes in source code over time.It allows multiple 
developers to work on a project simultaneously
Answer 2:-
In a CVCS, there is a single central repository that stores all the versioned files whereas In a DVCS, every developer has a 
complete copy of the repository, including its history, on their local machine. 
Answer 3:-
Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in source code during software development.on 
other hand,git hub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control and provides additional features such as issue 
tracking, project management, and collaboration tools. 
Answer 4:-
When a developer makes changes to files, they can add those changes to the staging area using the git add command
Answer 5:-
The .git folder is a hidden directory.It contains all the metadata and objects necessary for version control.
Answer 6:-
Git branching is a feature that allows developers to create separate lines of development within a repository
for creating new branch:- git branch <branch-name>
for switching to another branch:- git checkout <branch-name>
Answer 7:-
git reset is used to move the current branch pointer to a specified commit.git reset --hard also moves 
the current branch pointer to a specified commit, but it resets both the staging area and the working directory to match that commit. 
Answer 8:-
A squash merge is a type of merge that combines all the changes from a feature branch into a single commit before merging
it into the main branch.
Answer 9:-
git rebase is a command that allows you to integrate changes from one branch into another
Example:- consider a scenario where you have a main branch called main and a feature branch called feature. While you were
working on the feature branch, new commits were added to the main branch. To incorporate those changes into your feature branch, 
syou can use git rebase
